# ðŸ“± Legal Assistance â€“ Flutter Mobile App

The **Legal Assistance Flutter App** is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter and Dart, designed to provide seamless interaction between clients and legal professionals. It acts as the mobile frontend of the Legal Assistance system, which includes a powerful RESTful PHP & MySQL backend.

This app allows users to sign up, log in, search for lawyers, submit legal issues, and track case progress â€” all from their mobile devices. The app also integrates with a **recommendation system** to suggest top-rated lawyers and offers a **real-time secure chat** system for client-lawyer communication.
